A project gauging the prediction of a future stock price being reached. Using a combination of the Monte Carlo and the geometric Brownian motion (GBM) models, a user is able to see a potential future trajectory of the stock. The Brownian model assumes that a "constant drift is accompanied by random shocks" (Investopedia). The combination of the model allows for the prediction to be calculated
