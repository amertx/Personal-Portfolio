I am currently a Software Engineering student at The University of Texas at Dallas, interested in pursuing a career that blends finance and technology. 

Ever since high school, I have taken part in endeavors that have propeled my creativity and learning. My experiences over the years at numerous hackathons and technology panels have enabled me to build an extensive network of collaboration with developers at FANG and Fintech companies.

Spending time researching and implementing new frameworks and technologies are some of the ways that I have found myself to become more active in spaces such as data science and predictive modeling.
Building projects to me is not just about the reward or monetary value that it could achieve, but also the long-term impact it could provide me in becoming a more versatile developer and problem solver. Moreover, analyzing relevant capitalmarket trends has become a new interest of mine. I enjoy seeking 
new methods and ways to develop and implement algorithmic scripts to measure volatility and price evaluations for stocks. 

In my free time I enjoy playing guitar, going to concerts, rockclimbing, exploring new forms of art and drinking coffee!
