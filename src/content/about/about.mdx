I am currently a Software Engineering student at The University of Texas at Dallas, interested in persuing a career that blends finance and technology. 

Ever since high school, I have dedicted a lot of my time and effort 

In my free time I enjoy playing guitar, going to concerts, exploring new forms of art and drinking coffee!
