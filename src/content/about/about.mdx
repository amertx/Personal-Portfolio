I am currently a Software Engineering & Finance student at The University of Texas at Dallas looking to graduate in December 2022. I have recently founded <a href="http://Fintech-utd.netlify.app" > FinTech UTD </a>, the first collegiate organization in North Texas focused on building software & research powering capital markets, robo-advisors and digital payments (Click the link above to learn more).

Spending time researching and implementing new frameworks are some ways that I have found myself to become more active in spaces such as data science and predictive modeling.
Building projects to me is not just about the reward or monetary value that it could achieve, but also the long-term impact it could provide me in becoming a more versatile developer and problem solver. Moreover, analyzing relevant capital market trends has become an avid interest of mine. I enjoy seeking
new methodologies to develop and implement algorithmic scripts to measure volatility, price evaluations for securities, identifying spreads and sourcing liquidity in macro indexes. Quantitative research and algorithmic trading are areas of which I am currently interested in pursuing in the next 5 years.

In my free time I enjoy playing guitar, going to concerts, rockclimbing, hiking, exploring new forms of art and drinking coffee!
